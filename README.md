## Detect vulnerabilities in your Clarity smart contracts using CodeQL

![alt text](img/Code_HoB2nKvYvE.gif)

This repository contains our team's ongoing research and development to extend CodeQL support to the Clarity smart contract language. We have adapted and expanded CodeQL to create a powerful toolset for performing static analysis on Clarity code.

## üîç Overview

Our goal is to provide a comprehensive set of tools for querying and detecting vulnerabilities in Clarity smart contracts. We build upon this [Clarity Tree-sitter grammar](https://github.com/xlittlerag/tree-sitter-clarity.git) and take a page from the CodeQL team's [Ruby implementation](https://github.blog/security/web-application-security/code-scanning-and-ruby-turning-source-code-into-a-queryable-database/). The project includes an extractor, database schema generation, and abstractions such as a cleaner Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), Control Flow Graph (CFG), and Dataflow analysis. These elements enable complex vulnerability detection and querying.

## üöÄ Project Status

- **Extractor and Database Schema**: ‚úÖ
- **A clean and intuitive AST**: ‚úÖ
- **Work in progress**: We are actively developing Controlflow and Dataflow support to enhance the detection of vulnerabilities.

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get started with analyzing Clarity smart contracts using CodeQL, follow these steps:

> [!NOTE]
> The installation guide will be simplified into an installation script, to set up all needed components smoothly.

- Follow the [CodeQL installation guide](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli/setting-up-the-codeql-cli) to setup the `codeql` command.

- Clone the CodeQL libraries and utilities provided [here](https://github.com/github/codeql).

- Move the `clarity` folder inside the folder downloaded in the previous step.

- Inside the `clarity` folder, run the following script:
    ```bash
    ./scripts/create-extractor-pack.sh
    ```
    This will build the database extractor and Clarity database scheme.

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended that you download the VSCode CodeQL official extension, as it makes managing your databases and queries a lot easier.

You are ready to create a database and start analyzing!

## Create a Database for your project

Creating a database is the first step in analyzing your project, as CodeQL works by parsing your Clarity contracts into a database and then running detectors made in a query language.\
You may create a database running the following command

```bash
codeql database create --overwrite --search-path codeql/clarity/extractor-pack -l clarity /destination-dir-for-db/ -s /directory-of-project-to-scan/
```

## Run Sample Detectors

Once the database is created, you can run any detectors written in the QL language:

```bash
codeql query run /path-to-detector/ -d /path-to-created-database/
```

## Detectors

Our current list of sample detectors is located in `ClarityQL\clarity\ql\lib\codeql\[detectorName].qll`.

| Num | Detector    | What it Detects                                                      |
| --- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `assertBlockHeight` | Wrongful usage of block height                  |
| 2   | `callInsideAsContract` | Outside call inside an `as-contract` opcode |
| 3   | `privateFunctionsNotUsed` | Deadcode: unused functions declared as private    |
| 4   | `txSenderInAssert` |   Wrongful usage of `tx-sender`          |
| 5   | `divideBeforeMultiply` | Detects loss of precision  |
| 6   | `unusedArguments` | Arguments declared in a function but never used   |
| 7   | `unwrapPanicUsage` | Wrongful usage of a panic function    |
